# AlphaVPS Promo Codes and Latest AlphaVPS Affordable Hosting Deals for 2026

## AlphaVPS Introduction

You know how sometimes you stumble upon a hosting provider and think, "Where have you been all my life?" That's AlphaVPS for you.

Founded back in 2013 by DA International Group Ltd., this Bulgarian hosting company started with a simple idea: make quality VPS hosting accessible to everyone. Not just big corporations with deep pockets, but regular folks who need solid infrastructure without selling a kidney.

What makes AlphaVPS interesting is their no-nonsense approach. They own their hardware, run their own network (AS203380 for the tech nerds), and their Sofia office literally sits above their data center. That's commitment. When something breaks at 3 AM, they're not calling someone halfway across the world - they're taking the stairs.

The service portfolio covers what you'd actually need: cheap Linux VPS starting from €3.50/month, KVM virtual servers with dedicated resources, storage VPS for when you've got mountains of data, and dedicated servers when you're ready to go big. They've spread across five locations - Bulgaria, Germany, UK, Los Angeles, and New York - so you can pick whatever's closest to your audience.

Their network runs on 500+ Gbps capacity with Juniper gear. That's the good stuff. Multiple Tier-1 providers, tons of local peering, and they're not shy about their 99.9% uptime guarantee. They've got the track record to back it up too.

The support team is in-house, which means you're talking to people who actually know what they're doing. No ticket escalations, no waiting for "Tier 3" to wake up. Just engineers who can solve your problem without reading from a script.

## AlphaVPS Promo Codes

Alright, let's talk savings. Because who doesn't like keeping more money in their pocket?

**Active Promo Codes for 2026:**

**50OFFEPYC** - This is the big one. 50% off your first month on all EPYC Cloud VPS plans. If you've been eyeing those AMD EPYC servers (and you should be, they're monsters), this is your chance.

**L3YCT6LM3V** - 29% discount on AMD EPYC VPS plans for your first month. Available in Nuremberg, Germany and Sofia, Bulgaria. Not the biggest discount, but it's something.

**HOLIDAYS-2021** - Here's a fun one. This code is technically old, but it still works. 20% recurring discount for EPYC Cloud VPS series. That means it applies to every invoice, not just the first one. Worth a shot.

**Email Newsletter Bonus** - Sign up for their newsletter and you'll get a 10% discount code for your first Storage VPS invoice. Plus you'll hear about deals before everyone else.

**How to use these codes:** Pretty straightforward. Pick your plan, head to checkout, look for the "Promo Code" or "Discount Code" box, paste the code, and click apply. The discount should show up immediately. If it doesn't, the code might have expired or doesn't apply to your specific plan.

**A few things to remember:** Most of these are first-month or new-customer deals. You can't stack multiple codes on one order (tried it, doesn't work). And some special offer plans don't accept promo codes at all - they're already discounted.

**What you need to know:**

All VPS plans come with full root access, instant deployment after payment, and your choice of OS (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS). The KVM plans support Docker and Kubernetes out of the box, plus full disk encryption if you're paranoid about security (you should be).

The AMD EPYC plans are the sweet spot for performance. Those chips are beasts, and the NVMe storage makes everything snappy. If you're running anything that needs real computing power, go EPYC.

Storage VPS plans are built on RAID-60/RAID-10 HDD arrays. Not lightning fast, but perfect for backups, media storage, or anything where capacity matters more than speed.

Dedicated servers are rapidly deployed and fully customizable. No, seriously - they let you configure pretty much everything before it ships.

## AlphaVPS Reviews

Let's hear what actual users have to say. Because marketing copy is one thing, but real experiences tell the story.

The Trustpilot score sits at a solid 4.6 out of 5 stars from over 135 reviews. That's not just good - that's "people are actually happy" territory.

**The Good Stuff:**

People love the uptime. One customer mentioned running a storage VPS for three years with 464 days of uptime on one stretch. That's rock-solid reliability.

Support gets consistent praise. Fast responses (we're talking minutes, not hours), knowledgeable staff who actually solve problems, and they're available 24/7. One reviewer managing 20 machines with AlphaVPS specifically called out the responsive and professional support team.

The value proposition hits home. You're getting enterprise-grade hardware and network infrastructure at prices that won't make your accountant cry. Several reviews mention switching from bigger names like AWS or DigitalOcean to consolidate costs.

Speed and performance are regularly mentioned. That Juniper network and RAID-10 SSD arrays aren't just marketing talk - users notice the difference.

**The Not-So-Good:**

The 72-hour money-back guarantee is shorter than industry standard. Most places give you 30 days. If you're testing, keep that timeline in mind.

Some locations (Bulgaria and Los Angeles) don't include DDoS protection by default. You'll need to pay extra for that.

The knowledge base could be more extensive. There are only a couple of tutorials, so you might be googling or opening tickets more than you'd like.

**What the community says:**

A developer on LowEndTalk shared his experience using AlphaVPS for video transcoding. The dedicated CPU cores performed exactly as advertised, converting 720p video at 1.3x speed. His conclusion? The CPU requirement for his use case was met perfectly, and he couldn't find a better deal after extensive searching.

From the hosting review sites, AlphaVPS ranks well for specialized VPS hosting, even if they're not the biggest name out there. The consensus is that being a smaller provider works in their favor - you're not just another account number.

**The bottom line from users:**

If you need solid VPS hosting with good support and great pricing, AlphaVPS delivers. They're not trying to be everything to everyone - they focus on VPS and dedicated servers, and they do it well. The company's been around since 2013, they own their infrastructure, and they're not going anywhere.
